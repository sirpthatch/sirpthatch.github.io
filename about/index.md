title: About Thatcher
---

Hi there - My name is Thatcher Clay, I am a software developer, live in NYC, work at Two Sigma, and I am interested in exploring myself and the world around me through data.  I am a runner (long distance trail running), biker (fixie city biking), and rock climber (trad is rad!).  Hit me up at thatcher (dot) clay (at) gmail (dot) com.
