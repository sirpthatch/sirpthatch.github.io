title: About Thatcher
---

Hi there - I am a software developer, live in NYC, work in finance, and I am interested in measuring various aspects of my life to better understand how I tick.  Data driven life.  I am a runner (long distance trail running), biker (fixie city biking), and rock climber (trad is rad!).  Hit me up at thatcher (dot) clay (at) gmail (dot) com.
