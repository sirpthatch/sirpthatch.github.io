I am throwing up this blog as a placeholder for future content.  I have made a bunch of progress on my quantified self project, a project aimed at measuring aspects of my life and enabling me to draw insights about what makes me happy and productive, and I aim to share pieces of that here.  First step to sharing - understanding jekyll apparently!  Super easy, kudos to that team.
