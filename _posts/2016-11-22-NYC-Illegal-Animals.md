There are animals on the streets!  Well, not really - but there are a surprising number of "illegal" pets reported throughout the city.  1592 to be exact, since 2010.  So what are these pets, and where are they?

### Number 3: Snakes

Apparently there have been 150 reports of snakes slithering about the city, accounting for about 9.4% of all the illegal pets.  [Ophiophobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophidiophobia) might be a little distraught to see that they are fairly well distributed throughout the boroughs.  I am overjoyed to see that several snakes have been reported in the area around the gowanus canal, near my home.

### Number 2: Farm Animals

Narrowly beating out snakes, there have been 179 reports of "farm animals" around the city, or about 11.2% of all reports.  Presumably this covers a wide range of animals - goats, sheep, cows maybe.  There is a conspicuous concentration of reports filed around the Wall Street area - perhaps people are calling in the [bull of Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_Bull).

### Number 1: Roosters!

Flying away with the lead, roosters have been behind 832 of the complaints, or about 52% of all illegal pet complaints in NYC.  Roosters!  Who would have thought...  But, I suppose there is some selection bias afoot here.  A secret pet goat might be easier to hide than a rooster who happily greets the day for all their neighbors to hear.  Somewhat surprisingly, it looks like you can find them virtually everywhere in the city.

### Honorable Mentions

There are other reported pets that did not make the top 3 - including a catchall category of "Other" that accounts for 359 (23%) of all the illegal pets.  There are also 44 instances of ferrets, 16 instances of iguanas, 9 instances of monkeys, and 3 instances of turtles (specifically turtles under 4 inches long, illegal since they are a source of salmonella according to the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/guidancecomplianceenforcement/complianceenforcement/ucm090573.htm)).

Who knew there was such an eclectic array of pets in NYC?  I am a dog person, but if roosters are more your jam, looks like you are definitely not alone!
